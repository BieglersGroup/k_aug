## INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DEPENDENCIES
Make sure gcc is installed (including gfortran). 
Some systems might need `zlib1g-dev`. 
If you do not have it, please use something like:
 `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev` or an equivalent command.

Please run the `help` scripts in the **following order**:
1. ASL
2. metis
3. scotch

5. mumps

The websites might be mumps/metis/scotch so please be patient if that is the case.

Note that we do not provide mc30 from the hsl library.
